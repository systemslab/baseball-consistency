Compiled classes are already present in bin folder.

To run the compiled classes, go to bin folder.

Open a terminal and run the following commands:

1. rmiregistry &
2. java Clusters.BaseballCluster

open terminal 2
1. java Proxy.BaseballProxy (for strong consistency)

open terminal 3

1. java Clients.Client (Reading 1 key at a time, total 10 keys)
2. java Clients.BaseballClient (Reading 2 keys at a time, Total 2 keys)

To rerun the experiments terminate all three process and run again.


If you want to compile the code, go to the src folder and compile appropriate files

javac Clients/Client.java ../Proxy/Client_Proxy_interface.java
javac Proxy/BaseballProxy.java Clusters/Proxy_Cluster_interface.java
javac Clusters/BaseballCluster.java

and run the class files from the src directory.
